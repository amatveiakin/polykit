# PolyKit

A toolkit for polylogarithms. Contains a set functions that compute
polylogarithm symbols and formal symbols. These functions are highly
specific. This is neither a computer algebra system nor a tool for
numeric computations. Only polylogarithms of pure variables and
cross-ratio are supported. The advantage of this software is that it's
faster that general-purpose computer algerbra systems.

PolyKit was used to verify equations from https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05599.
