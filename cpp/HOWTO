1. Install a modern C++ compiler with C++17 support.
2. Install Bazel: https://bazel.build/.
3. Execute `run.bat` (Windows) or `run.sh` (Linux/MacOS). Bazel should install
   the dependencies, build and run the project. Internet connection is required
   for the first run.

To execute tests use: `test` for a limited set fast of tests, `test_extra` to
run most tests, and `test_everything` to run all tests (slow).

Tested compilers: Clang 10.0.0, MSVC 14.0 (C/C++ compiler version 19.27.29112).

C++/Python bindings are supported only in Linux/MacOS builds for now. The
recommended way of compiling Python bindings in Windows is via Windows Subsystem
for Linux (WSL).

Note. If working with Unicode in Windows command prompt, type `chcp 65001`.
For best performance it is also suggested to use "DejaVu Sans Mono" font.
